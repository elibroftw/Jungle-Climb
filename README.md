A platformer I made with pygame as an experiment.

## Python Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. You will need python 3.6+ with pip
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run main.py

## Build instructions (Windows only for now)
1. Follow the previous procedure
2. Have Inno Setup installed and on PATH (Windows only)
3. Run build.cmd or `python setup.py build && iscc "Installer Script.iss"`

## Controls
A / Left Arrow key - Run Left

D / Right Arrow key - Run Right

There are also menu key board shortcuts which can be guessed intuitively (Space, Escape, R, M, V, H)
